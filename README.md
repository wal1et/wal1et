👋 Hi, I'm Wal1et, a Computer Science student.

👀 I'm interested in software development, machine learning, and data science. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and help me learn new skills.

🌱 I'm currently learning Python, Java, and SQL. I'm also studying algorithms and data structures to improve my problem-solving skills.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects that align with my interests. I'm particularly interested in projects related to natural language processing and computer vision.
